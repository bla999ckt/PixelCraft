# üéÆ Breakout Game ‚Äì OpenGL & GLUT Edition

A colorful and interactive implementation of the classic Breakout game using **OpenGL** and **GLUT**, designed and developed in **Xcode (macOS)** with compatibility on **Windows (Code::Blocks)**. Players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks, with difficulty modes that dynamically affect gameplay visuals and mechanics.

## Core Components

- `drawPaddle()` ‚Äì Draws the paddle with blue color.
- `drawBall()` ‚Äì Renders the ball with difficulty-dependent color.
- `drawBrick()` ‚Äì Draws a single brick; color changes with difficulty.
- `drawBricks()` ‚Äì Renders the full grid of bricks.
- `drawPopup()` ‚Äì Displays game result or instructions.
- `drawEasyBackground()` & `drawHardBackground()` ‚Äì Unique backgrounds based on difficulty.
- `update()` ‚Äì Main game logic: collision detection, movement, score, win/loss checks.
- `keyboard()` ‚Äì Keyboard input handling.
- `main()` ‚Äì GLUT initialization and event loop setup.

## Customization Ideas

- Add unique background themes and effects.
- Design personalized bricks and paddle shapes.
- Tweak animations and transitions.
- Implement multiplayer or advanced scoring mechanics.

## My Role & Contributions

This project was built collaboratively, and I focused on:
- Core gameplay mechanics: paddle movement, ball dynamics, and collision logic.
- Implementing the real-time scoring and game state logic.
- Designing a difficulty selection system that changes visual styles and gameplay behavior.

## Run the Project

### Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/bla999ckt/PixelCraft.git
   cd PixelCraft/C_and_OpenGl
   git sparse-checkout set breakout%20game
   cd breakout%20game
   ```

### Requirements

To run this program, you‚Äôll need:

- A C compiler (`gcc`, `clang`, or MSVC)
- OpenGL libraries
- FreeGLUT (or GLUT) installed

## üíª How to Compile & Run

### üêß Linux
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install freeglut3-dev build-essential
gcc main.c -o main -lglut -lGLU -lGL
./main
```
### üçé macOS (with Homebrew)
```bash
brew install freeglut
gcc main.c -o main -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT
./main
```
### ü™ü Windows (MinGW + FreeGLUT)
1. Install MinGW and FreeGLUT.
2.Place freeglut.dll in the same folder as your executable.
3. Compile using:
```bash
gcc main.c -o main.exe -lfreeglut -lopengl32 -lglu32
main.exe
```
You may need to adjust include paths if your GLUT headers/libraries are in non-default locations.

## Future Improvements

- Add sound effects and background music.
- Create level progression and increasing difficulty.
- Introduce power-ups like multi-ball or extended paddle.
- Add saving high scores or pause/resume features.
